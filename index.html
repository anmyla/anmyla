                        <p>I am Cookie and just like  what my website's title say, this site is all about me!</p>
                        <p>I know how curious you are about the really beautiful cat that has adopted the little family of which Myla--the one who created this website, a.k.a. one of my slaves, is a part of. So yeah, here are all the juicy details about me. A little caution though, the pictures might look sweet and yes I am sweet but only when I am in the mood. And when I am not, I can be the snobbiest cat you'll ever know. I'll try to be friendly but if you think I still sound nasty, well I supposed you should better look for a dog's website instead. </p>

                <h2>A Day in My Life</h2>
                <p>1.  I wake up in the morning pretty much around the time when my one of my humans wake up. The one with the anoyingly long hair is usualy the one to get up first eventhough I know she wishes she can stay longer in bed. Sometimes, I wake up ealier than her so I have to make a lot of noise to kinda rush her to wake up already because I need my cat-potty cleaned before I can go in it again. She's pretty slow specially in the morning!</p>

                <p>2.  Morning routine includes potty, breakfast, and then waiting for my male human to finish showering because he has to kinda give ma a "shower" too by stroking me with his wet freshly washed hands and then he brushes my hair afterwards. After that, I clean myself more because these humans simply dont know how to make it properly. </p>

                <p>3.  After all those routines, I pretty much sleep. I just wake up again when I need to go to the potty or when I am hungy or thirsty. When I am not busy, I like to just hang out by the window pane and watch what's happening outside the house. Sometimes the cat neighboor comes by and stare at me for a long time. To be honest, I dont exactly know what he wants but I beleive he just wants to admire me so yeah, he can drool but he aint gettin' any of this awesomeness.</p>

                <summary>Some Not-So-Secret Details About Me</summary>
                <p>I am born on August 15, 2021 and I adopted my humans in November of that year. I am a purebred Russian Blue cat with beautiful grey fur that does not shed as much as other cats. My breed is considered as the most hypoallergenic breed of cats because we barely produce those allergens that are harmful to people with cat allergies. I live with my adopted humans in the suburbs of Graz and my humans are the kindest pets a cat can ever have. I love them to pieces but of course, I never tell them that.</p>
